# Project 3 - Palindrome Detector

Welcome to Project 3 - Palindrome Detector! This project invites you to explore and practice the Adapter/Wrapper pattern, work with different data structures like Stack and Queue, and put them to use in creating a Palindrome Detector.

## Overview

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). This project involves:

- Implementing the Adapter/Wrapper design pattern.

- Creating a custom Stack class utilizing a singly linked-list (std::forward_list) as the underlying data structure.

- Creating a custom Queue class employing a doubly linked-list (std::list) as the underlying data structure.

- Combining the Stack and Queue classes to develop a palindrome detector.
